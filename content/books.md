  <h2 class='page-header'>Programming in CoffeeScript</h2>
  <p><span class='thumbnail img-left'><img title="Programming CoffeeScript" src="/assets/images/2012/02/cover_300.png" alt="" width="300" height="386" /></span>For millions of web developers, CoffeeScript is emerging as one of today's most exciting new technologies. A superset of JavaScript, it enables experienced Javascript developers to write better, clearer code: software that's more concise, maintainable, flexible, reliable, and secure. CoffeeScript's inclusion in the popular web framework, Ruby on Rails, has brought CoffeeScript to an immense new audience.</p> 

  <p>Programming in CoffeeScript covers everything experienced web developers need to evaluate CoffeeScript, "think" in CoffeeScript, and write high-performance software with it. Mark Bates follows the proven format of other "Programming in" books in our Developers' Library series, with one major addition: he presents multiple same-page code comparisons demonstrating exactly how CoffeeScript improves upon JavaScript. Both a tutorial and reference, this book first introduces CoffeeScript's basic concepts, and then shows how to build a full fledged application with it. Bates covers functions, scope, collections, iterations, classes, modules, CoffeeScript's innovative Cake build system testing with the popular Jasmine framework, and much more - concluding with a full application that uses CoffeeScript on both the server side, using popular tools such as Express, Node.js, and Mongoose (MongoDB), and the client side, with jQuery and Backbone.js.</p>

    <strong>Complete, Hands-On Guide to Building Advanced Distributed Applications with Ruby</strong>
  </p>

  <p>Distributed programming techniques make applications easier to scale, develop, and deploy—especially in emerging cloud computing environments. Now, one of the Ruby community’s leading experts has written the first definitive guide to distributed programming with Ruby.</p>

  <p>Mark Bates begins with a simple distributed application, and then walks through an increasingly complex series of examples, demonstrating solutions to the most common distributed programming problems.</p>

  <p>Bates presents the industry’s most useful coverage of Ruby’s standard distributed programming libraries, DRb and Rinda. Next, he introduces powerful third-party tools, frameworks, and libraries designed to simplify Ruby distributed programming, including his own Distribunaut.</p>

  <p>If you’re an experienced Ruby programmer or architect, this hands-on tutorial and practical reference will help you meet any distributed programming challenge, no matter how complex.</p>
