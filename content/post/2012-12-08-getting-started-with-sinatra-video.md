In an earlier video we took a look at Rack to build incredibly lightweight web applications with Ruby. Rack's toolkit allowed us to quickly throw to get a working application, but we did have to put a little effort into it once we wanted to build something a little more complex.

Sometimes you want a fast and simple framework for building a simple web application. Perhaps you only need to respond to a handful of routes, or you want the response time for a small part of a bigger application to be lighting fast. The [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) framework is made for just these moments.

Today let's take a quick look at this framework and see how quickly we can build lightweight web applications.
