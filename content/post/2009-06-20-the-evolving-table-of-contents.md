For those of you who have checked out the Rough Cuts version of my book, "Distributed Programming with Ruby", I thought you would like to get a peek into how the Table of Contents is going to change shortly. For those of you who haven't seen the old Table of Contents, or are just plain old interested to see what's going to be in the book, or to see how far along with the book I am, here is the current Table of Contents as of tonight:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/133394.js"></script>

As you can see it has evolved quite a bit from what was posted on Rough Cuts just about a month ago. Chances are that it will probably change again, and as it does, I'll try and keep you all posted. There is talk of adding a large chapter at the end that takes a handful of the technologies I discuss in the book and use them to build a "real world" example application, like a Twitter clone, or something like that. If anyone has any good ideas on what they would like to see for this example, please them my way, I'd love to hear them.

If there are no sections listed below a particular chapter that means that I have either not written it yet, or I'm still too early in that chapter's development to have properly assigned it actual sections.

The first draft of the book is slated for the end of July. So there is still a lot of work to be done, but it's still rather exciting. Well, it's exciting for me at least. Talk to you all soon.
