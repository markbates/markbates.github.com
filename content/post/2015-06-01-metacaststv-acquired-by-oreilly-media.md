For the past two and half years I have prided myself on bringing MetaCasts.tv subscribers high quality, educational screencasts on a variety of subjects, from Ruby to JavaScript to Go. In that time I have produced almost 37 hours of video. It has been a remarkably fun ride, but that ride has now come to an end.

When I announced that MetaCasts.tv would be shutting down there was a lot of speculation as to why, but at the time I was unable to provide any specifics behind it. Well, now I can. I’m happy to announce that O’Reilly Media, Inc. has acquired MetaCasts.tv. Over the coming months I will work closely with the great team over at O’Reilly to make all of the MetaCasts content available on their properties.

While I will not be joining the O’Reilly team, I will, however, be producing new content with them from time to time in the future.

I am very excited about the opportunity to see these screencasts get in the hands of a lot of developers, to help them grow and learn, and I can’t think of a better partner to do that with than O’Reilly.

Thank you all, again, for your great support over the past two and a half years. It’s been wonderful!
