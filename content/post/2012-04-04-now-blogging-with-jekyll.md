title: Now Blogging with Jekyll

As you may or may not have noticed there's a new blog in town! That's right, I've ditched the zero, WordPress, and got with the hero, [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). And I have to say, it sure feels good.

WordPress worked well for me for years, but I have to say that I never enjoyed the process of writing a technical blog in a browser. I hated the lack of tools that my editor has at it's disposal. It was too slow to do previews with. And all together it just always felt a bit "hacky", and not in a good way.

Jekyll let's me write my blog entries in my favorite local text editor. I can preview my blog, locally, which is great if you want to make a sweeping change to the whole thing. When I'm done writing I can do a <code>git push</code> and the site now has all the new content.

I know that I haven't been that great over the last few months at keeping this blog up to date. Part of that was due to writing a new book, [Programming in CoffeeScript](http://books.markbates.com), and the other because I just didn't like writing in WordPress. I'm hoping that now that I've got a bit more of a "hacker" friendly way of blogging, that I get back into the habit of blogging more often.

Here's to the hopes of happy blogging!
