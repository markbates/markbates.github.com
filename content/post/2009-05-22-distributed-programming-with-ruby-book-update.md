Hey there folks, I know it's been awhile, so I thought I would give you all a very quick update as to how the book is going. It's going really well. I'm about 100 pages into it, and it's shaping up very nicely. Addison-Wesley is preparing to put it into their "Rough Cuts" program so you can all get your dirty little hands on what I've written so far as early as a few weeks from now, or so I'm told.

While I don't want to give too much away about the contents, everybody loves a good surprise, let me say that part one of the book will be the most comprehensive guide to DRb and Rinda that you'll find anywhere. Including the source code!!

I'm working hard on part two of the book which focuses on third party tools, frameworks, and libraries. It's quite a fun part of the book to write as there are a great deal of choices out there, including my own Distribunaut. (PS. I released a new version of it on GitHub a week or so ago.) Writing about different libraries is quite fun as I get to really delve into the source code and see the good and bad ways people like to write code. Plus some of the libraries have really great features, or really turn things on their head.

When the book is available as a "Rough Cut", I'll certainly keep you all informed. In the mean time keep watching this space and have a great weekend!
