I've just started to work on a series of screencasts. The topics will be varied, but will center around Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, iOS, and the like, ranging in time from 2 minutes to 10-15 minutes.

Because I'm just starting to get my feet wet in this area I thought I would share the first of these screencasts with everyone here in the hopes of getting some feedback, good or bad.

So without further adieu I offer up to you my first screencast, "CoffeeScript: Fat Arrow Functions". Enjoy!
