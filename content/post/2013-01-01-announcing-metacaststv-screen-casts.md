One of my favorite things to do is learn. I love learning. It's been a central tenet of my life. When I was 11 I taught myself to play guitar and then ended up receiving an honors BA degree in music years later. During college I taught myself how to program and have spent the last 14 years as a professional developer. I've parlayed my love of learning into a successful career that has included working with some of the brightest minds in the industry, authoring two books, and speaking at conferences all around the world.

One of my favorite ways to learn is through video. I love watching videos about technology. I love seeing it in action. I love hearing the tips and tricks as they come up. I find it to be an incredibly immersive and engaging experience, as well as a fun way to learn. It's like having a pairing partner right there with you.

Because of my love of screen casts and learning I have decided to launch [MetaCasts.tv](http://www.metacasts.tv)! MetaCasts are weekly screen casts that center around Ruby and related technologies, such as JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Rails, etc... All of the screen casts are presented in HD and are available to watch on all platforms! You can even subscribe to them in iTunes and new episodes will automatically be downloaded for you.

As of right now there will be a guaranteed new video each week. Some weeks there will be more, but never less. When I reach a threshold of subscribers to focus on MetaCasts 100% then you can expect 2-3 videos a week, plus longer form videos as well. If you'd like that to happen, then I strongly encourage you to sign up now, and spread the word!

I'm very excited about this new venture, and I hope you are too! So please head on over to [MetaCasts.tv](http://www.metacasts.tv) now and check it out. You won't be disappointed.
