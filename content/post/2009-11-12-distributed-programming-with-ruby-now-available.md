Well folks, it's been a long road, nearly a year since I presented the idea for "Distributed Programming with Ruby" to Obie Fernandez in a hot tub in Florida, but finally my book is done, dusted, back from the printers and available for purchase from a variety of places, include [Amazon.com](http://books.markbates.com)!

It was an absolutely amazing experience and I can't thank everyone involved with the project enough for all of their help, guidance, and having to put up with me over the past year.

I would go into detail about all the people I wish to thank, but I did that already in the book, and let's be honest, you're going to buy it and read it anyway, so I don't want to ruin the surprise. :)

I'm sure you've already purchased your copy, but if you haven't might I recommend you pop over to [Amazon](http://books.markbates.com) right now and pick yourself up a copy. They're selling pretty well and you don't want to miss out, do you? I didn't think so.

If you are someone with a popular blog and you would like to do a review of the book, please drop me a line and I'll see what we can do about hooking you up with a copy. Please understand, though, the publishers aren't going to send out copies to everyone who requests them, so there will be a bit of vetting going on.

Also, if you have already purchased the book if you wouldn't mind leaving a review of it on [Amazon](http://books.markbates.com), that would be much appreciated. It doesn't matter where you bought the book, if you could leave a review there, it will really make a difference. Thanks.
