Congratulations to Sean Powell, [@seanpowell](http://twitter.com/seanpowell), who won last month's [contest](/2014/09/01/100th-episode--a-free-ticket-to-gothamgo/) to win a free ticket to the [GothamGo](http://www.gothamgo.com) conference in New York City in November, courtesy of [MetaCasts.tv](http://www.metacasts.tv?source=blog).

I'm really excited that MetaCasts is sponsoring this great conference, and I'm even more excited that I was able to help someone like Sean, a supporter of MetaCasts, get to go to the conference. If you haven't already purchased your ticket for the conference, you should hurry up, it's going to be great!

If you are going to be there, find me, come say hi, and don't forget to ask me for a MetaCasts sticker!
