<img src="/assets/images/2014/01/unix_300.png" class='img-left' width="200px"> I'm really happy today to announce my newest book, and screencasts, "Conquering the Command Line". This is a book I've been wanting as a developer since I first begin my career in the late 90s. Let me explain a little bit about my background to help you understand why I've always wanted this book.

My background, that is to say my degree, is in music. That's right, music, not computer science. Because of my unorthodox path into programming I was never taught how to really get the most out of the command line that I spend most of my day working in. Over the years I've picked up tips and tricks from my fellow developers, screencasts, and from scouring the web.

What I really wish I had, back when I was first starting out, was a book that help me understand the most useful commands, and within that the most useful flags and options, to help boost my productivity when in the command line. That's what this book is all about. Increasing your productivity when using the command line, which as developers, is where we spend most of our day.

> "Learn to master and conquer the most valuable and useful command line tools for Unix and Linux based systems. In this book you will find not only the most useful command line tools you need to know, but also the most helpful options and flags for those tools. Conquering the Command Line isn't just a rehash of the MAN page for these tools, but rather human-readable walk-through of these tools to make you instantly more productive in your daily development life."

I'm really excited by this book, and I hope you are too. It takes a lot of people to help make a book possible. I would like to thank Michael Hartl (and the rest of the gang at Softcover.io), Pat Shaughnessy, Pete Brown, Michael Denomy, Johnny Bourisquot, and Dan Pickett for all of their help making this book as good as it is.

#### If reading isn't your thing there are nearly 5 hours of videos also available that include, not only the content from the book, but also exclusive content not found anywhere else.
