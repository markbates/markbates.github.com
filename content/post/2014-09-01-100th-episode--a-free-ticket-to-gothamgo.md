### Win a Free Ticket to GothamGO!

Today I released the 100th episode of [MetaCasts](http://www.metacasts.tv)! To help celebrate that I want to give one lucky subscriber a free ticket to the [GothamGo](http://gothamgo.com) conference in New York City on November 15th.

On October 1st I will choose a winner from the active MetaCasts subscribers with a yearly plan.

**Current subscribers**: If you're already a yearly subscriber, congrats, you don't have to do anything to enter. If you're a monthly subscriber, just upgrade to a yearly plan and you'll be entered.

**Everyone else**: For those of you who aren't subscribers, what are you waiting for? Register as a yearly subscriber between now and the end of September to be entered to win.

**Pro-tip**: Yearly team subscriptions get more entries in the contest. For example, if you have a yearly team plan for 5 members then you have 5 chances to win. Pretty simple. :)

Good luck to everyone, and if I haven't said it lately, thank you again for all of your support!
