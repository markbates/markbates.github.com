If you're writing web applications with Ruby there comes a time when you might need something a lot simpler, or even faster, than Ruby on Rails or the Sinatra micro-framework. Enter Rack.

In this 5:25 minute long video we'll quickly explore the Rack framework, which powers Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and a whole host of other frameworks. We'll start with a one line Rack application and move on to write a very simple web framework using this powerful tool.

### UPDATE:
A lot of people have asked about a gist of the code, here it is [https://gist.github.com/4240848](https://gist.github.com/4240848) it's the full script of the screen cast along with all of the code. Enjoy!

### UPDATE:

This video is now available on [MetaCasts.tv](http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/getting-started-with-rack). A new screen cast subscription site that focuses on Ruby and related technologies, such as Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript and more.
