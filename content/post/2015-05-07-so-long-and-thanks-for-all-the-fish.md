On January 1st, 2013 I [announced](http://metabates.com/2013/01/01/announcing-metacaststv-screen-casts/) MetaCasts.tv a weekly screencast site that would focus on Ruby, JavaScript, and any other technologies I thought fun, exciting, and interesting. The response was great. I couldn't believe how well received it was. In July of 2014 I [announced](http://metabates.com/2014/07/08/metacasts-golang-future/)  that MetaCasts.tv would be focused entirely on [Go](http://golang.org). It was a scary move, but it paid off. The change was welcomed with an overwhelming positive response.

Now, nearly a year after making the switch to Go, and almost two and a half years since starting MetaCasts.tv I have made the decision that, as much as I love MetaCasts, I must let it go. It was not an easy decision to make, but it is the right one.

In the coming weeks I will be announcing plans for the future of MetaCasts, and yes, there is a future! You don't think I would just close up shop and go away, did you?

What does all of this mean for current MetaCasts subscribers? Well, as of May 11th, 2015, all active subscribers have been issued a pro-rated refund on their last subscription payment. That goes for both monthly and yearly subscribers. MetaCasts.tv will remain up and available until at least June 1st, which means if you were an active subscriber as of May 11th, 2015, you will be able to still watch, and download, all 37 hours worth of content.

In closing you can expect another post from me in a few weeks with further details about the future of MetaCasts.tv and it's content. I would also like to thank each and everyone of you for your support over the past two and a half years. It was such an amazing experience.

### Thank you.
