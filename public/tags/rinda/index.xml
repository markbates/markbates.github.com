      <description>&lt;p&gt;About.com became the first, that I know about, to review my book, &amp;ldquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;rdquo;. What a great first review to have as well. They rated the book 5 out of 5 stars! The review can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby.about.com/od/bookreviews/gr/distributedprogramming.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;ldquo;Anyone working with distributed programming in Ruby will want this book.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The only downside they saw in the book, was that they wanted it to be longer! I have to save something for the 2nd edition, don&amp;rsquo;t I? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased yours yet, I encourage you to do so. It&amp;rsquo;s on sale at &lt;a href=&#34;http://book.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have reviewed the book, or know of a review of the book, please pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: left; padding-right: 10px&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-231&#34; title=&#34;Distributed Programming with Ruby&#34; src=&#34;/assets/images/2009/06/0321638360_bates_mech_page_3-261x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Distributed Programming with Ruby&#34; width=&#34;261&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well folks, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long road, nearly a year since I presented the idea for &amp;ldquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;rdquo; to Obie Fernandez in a hot tub in Florida, but finally my book is done, dusted, back from the printers and available for purchase from a variety of places, include &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an absolutely amazing experience and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank everyone involved with the project enough for all of their help, guidance, and having to put up with me over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go into detail about all the people I wish to thank, but I did that already in the book, and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, you&amp;rsquo;re going to buy it and read it anyway, so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to ruin the surprise. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased your copy, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t might I recommend you pop over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now and pick yourself up a copy. They&amp;rsquo;re selling pretty well and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out, do you? I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are someone with a popular blog and you would like to do a review of the book, please drop me a line and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what we can do about hooking you up with a copy. Please understand, though, the publishers aren&amp;rsquo;t going to send out copies to everyone who requests them, so there will be a bit of vetting going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have already purchased the book if you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind leaving a review of it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, that would be much appreciated. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where you bought the book, if you could leave a review there, it will really make a difference. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;buy-distributed-programming-with-ruby-today-http-books-markbates-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Buy &amp;ldquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;rdquo; Today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>Almost There... Book Wise.</title>
      <link>/2009/07/27/almost-there-book-wise/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now entering the home stretch of writing the Distributed Programming with Ruby book. I&amp;rsquo;m just a few weeks away, well, technically I&amp;rsquo;m hours away from finishing the last chapter (Delayed Job) in the official table of contents, however, I&amp;rsquo;m going to add another chapter and a half. Why? Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m a glutton for punishment. That and I want to deliver the best book possible. The extra chapter and a half, not featured in the table of contents below, will be on MapReduce technologies. It&amp;rsquo;s a really hot topic, and I think it will fit well in the book. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2009-07-29T03:01:37+00:00&#34;&gt;Unfortunately, the &amp;ldquo;Rough Cuts&amp;rdquo; book on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Safari site hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in nearly 3 months! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. I keep asking my editor to update it, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will soon, especially since the first draft of the entire manuscript will be done in just a few weeks!&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Today they updated the &amp;ldquo;Rough Cuts&amp;rdquo; with nearly the latest revisions. It&amp;rsquo;s still missing the chapters on Delayed Job and BackgrounDRb, but it&amp;rsquo;s closer than it was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as a public service announcement to you, the readers, I thought I would the table of contents as it stands right now, so you have a better idea of what the book is going to be about. So here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/156861.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Does it look good? Is this something you&amp;rsquo;d buy? Let me know. This is your chance to have an influence on a book. If you think something is missing or should be laid out differently, please let me know, it might just make it into the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough delaying here, let me get back to writing so I can finish up the Delayed Job chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Evolving Table of Contents</title>
      <link>/2009/06/20/the-evolving-table-of-contents/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have checked out the Rough Cuts version of my book, &amp;ldquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;rdquo;, I thought you would like to get a peek into how the Table of Contents is going to change shortly. For those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the old Table of Contents, or are just plain old interested to see what&amp;rsquo;s going to be in the book, or to see how far along with the book I am, here is the current Table of Contents as of tonight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/133394.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see it has evolved quite a bit from what was posted on Rough Cuts just about a month ago. Chances are that it will probably change again, and as it does, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and keep you all posted. There is talk of adding a large chapter at the end that takes a handful of the technologies I discuss in the book and use them to build a &amp;ldquo;real world&amp;rdquo; example application, like a Twitter clone, or something like that. If anyone has any good ideas on what they would like to see for this example, please them my way, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are no sections listed below a particular chapter that means that I have either not written it yet, or I&amp;rsquo;m still too early in that chapter&amp;rsquo;s development to have properly assigned it actual sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the book is slated for the end of July. So there is still a lot of work to be done, but it&amp;rsquo;s still rather exciting. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting for me at least. Talk to you all soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distributed Programming with Ruby Book Update</title>
      <link>/2009/05/22/distributed-programming-with-ruby-book-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>mark&#43;blog@markbates.com (Mark Bates)</author>
      <guid>/2009/05/22/distributed-programming-with-ruby-book-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there folks, I know it&amp;rsquo;s been awhile, so I thought I would give you all a very quick update as to how the book is going. It&amp;rsquo;s going really well. I&amp;rsquo;m about 100 pages into it, and it&amp;rsquo;s shaping up very nicely. Addison-Wesley is preparing to put it into their &amp;ldquo;Rough Cuts&amp;rdquo; program so you can all get your dirty little hands on what I&amp;rsquo;ve written so far as early as a few weeks from now, or so I&amp;rsquo;m told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don&amp;rsquo;t want to give too much away about the contents, everybody loves a good surprise, let me say that part one of the book will be the most comprehensive guide to DRb and Rinda that you&amp;rsquo;ll find anywhere. Including the source code!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working hard on part two of the book which focuses on third party tools, frameworks, and libraries. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a fun part of the book to write as there are a great deal of choices out there, including my own Distribunaut. (PS. I released a new version of it on GitHub a week or so ago.) Writing about different libraries is quite fun as I get to really delve into the source code and see the good and bad ways people like to write code. Plus some of the libraries have really great features, or really turn things on their head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the book is available as a &amp;ldquo;Rough Cut&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ll certainly keep you all informed. In the mean time keep watching this space and have a great weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Distribunaut</title>
      <link>/2009/04/05/distribunaut/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>/2009/04/05/distribunaut/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there everyone, it certainly has been awhile, a month by my count. I have been diligently working on a book for Addison-Wesley called, &amp;ldquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;rdquo;, so having the time to blog went from a luxury to almost non-existent. But here&amp;rsquo;s another little post to keep your RSS feeds happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started working on porting the mack-distributed package to the non-Mack world. This new project, and I use the term new loosely for the time being, is tentatively called Distribunaut. The project on GitHub can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/markbates/distribunaut/tree/master&#34;&gt;http://github.com/markbates/distribunaut/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty rough right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve ported over the distributed objects section of mack-distributed, but not the views and routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can install the gem like such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ gem sources -a &lt;a href=&#34;http://gems.github.com&#34;&gt;http://gems.github.com&lt;/a&gt;
$ sudo gem install markbates-distribunaut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use Distribunaut we first need to start a Rinda::RingServer. Distribunaut comes with a binary to help make this easier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ distribunaut_ring_server start&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we&amp;rsquo;ve done that we can create an object we would like to share:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/90620.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we run that we can access it like such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/90621.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would result in the following being printed out by our &amp;lsquo;client&amp;rsquo; code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/90622.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our &amp;lsquo;server&amp;rsquo; side we would see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/90623.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, clearly, a very simple example, but it shows you how easy it is to use Distribunaut. We haven&amp;rsquo;t done any real configuration, and things just magically work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ll be extending and rebuilding this library to make it even more powerful and easy to use. I&amp;rsquo;m going to add fault tolerance, selection algorithms, and whole lot more. The API you see in these examples will most likely remain unchanged, but I&amp;rsquo;m planning on pretty big under the cover changes.There will be a very in-depth look into all of this in the book, obviously. (Shameless plug, I know.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anybody out there wants to contribute to this project, I&amp;rsquo;d love the help. Any sort of feedback is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
