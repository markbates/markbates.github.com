      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When I first started &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2013 I set out to create a unique screen cast series. I wanted a series that didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on just one topic, just Ruby, just JavaScript, etc&amp;hellip; instead I wanted something that would challenge my subscribers, as well as myself. I wanted to talk about all sorts of technologies. I knew that some weeks the topic at hand might be incredibly relevant to viewers, and that other weeks it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. My hope was, and still is, that the weeks were the topic isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;relevant&amp;rdquo; that viewers will learn something new that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to grow and learn about topics outside of my daily comfort zone, so I&amp;rsquo;ve made &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; a venue for that. There are some episodes where I know the topic intimately, and there are others where I sat down, studied the topic, wrote lots of code, and presented my findings. All of it an educational experience as much for me, as my viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity I thought I would take a quick look some numbers related to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; and the topics that I&amp;rsquo;ve been covering there for just over the past year, and I thought I would share them with you. Personally, I found these numbers to be incredibly interesting. I was, for example very surprised to find out what language (programming, not spoken) was most prominently featured in the episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;total-hours-of-video-22-19-42&#34;&gt;Total Hours of Video: 22:19:42&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this post I have produced over 22 hours of video! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. I&amp;rsquo;m super happy with that number. That means as a subscriber you could fly from Boston to Sydney and still have episodes left over to watch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;average-video-length-00-17-23&#34;&gt;Average Video Length: 00:17:23&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average length of a MetaCasts episode is just over 17 minutes. That means over your morning cup of coffee or breakfast you can watch a whole episode and impress your friends at work with your depth of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-all-about-javascript-coffeescript&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s All About JavaScript (CoffeeScript)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at how much time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent covering different languages it would appear the clear winner is JavaScript/CoffeeScript, with Ruby in second place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align=&#39;center&#39;&gt;
  &lt;thead class=&#39;language-table&#39;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Total # of Hours&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody class=&#39;language-table&#39;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; CoffeeScript &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 13:05:26 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Ruby &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 06:37:19 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Go &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 01:00:56 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Bash &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:43:07 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; JavaScript &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:26:20 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; SQL &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:14:30 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Other &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:12:04 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are determined by the &amp;ldquo;primary language&amp;rdquo; of the video. For example a video about Ember.js would be listed as CoffeeScript, or JavaScript, even though the back-end might have been written using Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-purchased-video&#34;&gt;Most Purchased Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most purchased video on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising considering most subscribers are also Ruby on Rails developers; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/ember-js-pts-1-5-updated&#34;&gt;Ember.js Pts 1 - 5 [UPDATED]&lt;/a&gt;. Ember is an incredibly hot topic these days, especially amongst Rails developers, and whole of people have turned to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; to help them learn about it, and I&amp;rsquo;m honored to have helped them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for completeness the second most purchased video on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/angular-js-revised-pts-1-4&#34;&gt;Angular.js (revised) Pts 1 - 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of JavaScript frameworks, and neither can I. I love playing with them, and I love presenting my findings, sometimes good, sometimes bad, to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-watched-video&#34;&gt;Most Watched Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most watched video on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; was from February of 2013, in which I covered the recently released &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/ruby-2-0-0-rc2&#34;&gt;Ruby 2.0.0-rc2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, those are just a few of the fun numbers from over the past year or so. Looking at those numbers the ideal subscriber is a Ruby developer who wants to level up their JavaScript/CoffeeScript skills, as well as their Ruby, and along the way perhaps learn a bit about Go, SQL, Bash, and other fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how things are going with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve received amazing support from the community, subscribers, friends, and so many great people. So I guess as long as you&amp;rsquo;re willing to come along for the ride with me, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to keep generating new episodes for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Team Subscriptions for MetaCasts.tv</title>
      <link>/2013/12/10/team-subscriptions-for-metacaststv/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On January 1st of this year I &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/01/01/announcing-metacaststv-screen-casts/&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a weekly screencast site called, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv?source=blog-team-metacasts&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;, and I have been thrilled with the response it has received over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it&amp;rsquo;s first year I&amp;rsquo;ve released over 60 videos (17+ hours) on Ruby, Rails, Go, JavaScript, Node, Redis, iOS, and so much more, and next year I plan on releasing even more great videos on those topics, as well as new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response I&amp;rsquo;ve received for MetaCasts has been overwhelming positive. I get stopped at conferences by subscribers (from around the world) who just want to tell me how much they enjoy my videos. I get emails, tweets, and more thanking me for helping shed some light on an issue someone was having or for introducing them to a new topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that team support has been added to MetaCasts making it easier for companies and organizations to easily help their members level up their development skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team subscriptions are simple and easy to use. Simply create a new team subscription and enter the GitHub usernames of the users you want to have access to MetaCasts. That&amp;rsquo;s it. When they login, using their GitHub username, they&amp;rsquo;ll have full access to all of the MetaCasts episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing for team subscriptions depends on the amount of team members on the subscription. Team subscriptions, like single user subscriptions, come in both monthly and yearly plans, with yearly plans offering a significant discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with team subscriptions, as people have been asking for them for a while now. Learning, and growing, as a developer is incredibly important, so I encourage team leaders, managers, etc&amp;hellip; to help their teams out and sign up today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sign-up-metacasts-tv-http-www-metacasts-tv-source-blog-team-metacasts&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv?source=blog-team-metacasts&#34;&gt;Sign up - MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Announcing MetaCasts.tv Screen Casts</title>
      <link>/2013/01/01/announcing-metacaststv-screen-casts/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things to do is learn. I love learning. It&amp;rsquo;s been a central tenet of my life. When I was 11 I taught myself to play guitar and then ended up receiving an honors BA degree in music years later. During college I taught myself how to program and have spent the last 14 years as a professional developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve parlayed my love of learning into a successful career that has included working with some of the brightest minds in the industry, authoring two books, and speaking at conferences all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite ways to learn is through video. I love watching videos about technology. I love seeing it in action. I love hearing the tips and tricks as they come up. I find it to be an incredibly immersive and engaging experience, as well as a fun way to learn. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a pairing partner right there with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my love of screen casts and learning I have decided to launch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;! MetaCasts are weekly screen casts that center around Ruby and related technologies, such as JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Rails, etc&amp;hellip; All of the screen casts are presented in HD and are available to watch on all platforms! You can even subscribe to them in iTunes and new episodes will automatically be downloaded for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of right now there will be a guaranteed new video each week. Some weeks there will be more, but never less. When I reach a threshold of subscribers to focus on MetaCasts 100% then you can expect 2-3 videos a week, plus longer form videos as well. If you&amp;rsquo;d like that to happen, then I strongly encourage you to sign up now, and spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about this new venture, and I hope you are too! So please head on over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; now and check it out. You won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#39;text-align: center&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.metacasts.tv&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39; class=&#39;btn btn-large btn-primary&#39;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check out MetaCasts.tv&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short video we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at the basics of how JavaScript prototypes work. We&amp;rsquo;ll also look at a few of the fun things you can do with JavaScript prototypes, as well as how they can be dangerous if mis-used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is now available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/javascript-prototypes&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;. A new screen cast subscription site that focuses on Ruby and related technologies, such as Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting Started with Sinatra (Video)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an earlier video we took a look at Rack to build incredibly lightweight web applications with Ruby. Rack&amp;rsquo;s toolkit allowed us to quickly throw to get a working application, but we did have to put a little effort into it once we wanted to build something a little more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want a fast and simple framework for building a simple web application. Perhaps you only need to respond to a handful of routes, or you want the response time for a small part of a bigger application to be lighting fast. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sinatrarb.com/&#34;&gt;Sinatra&lt;/a&gt; framework is made for just these moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at this framework and see how quickly we can build lightweight web applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://player.vimeo.com/video/55188956&#34; width=&#34;620&#34; height=&#34;350&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitAllowFullScreen=&#34;webkitAllowFullScreen&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;mozallowfullscreen&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- fixes a wierd problem with jekyll --&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full script, including source code, can be found here &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/4243330&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/4243330&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re writing web applications with Ruby there comes a time when you might need something a lot simpler, or even faster, than Ruby on Rails or the Sinatra micro-framework. Enter Rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this 5:25 minute long video we&amp;rsquo;ll quickly explore the Rack framework, which powers Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, and a whole host of other frameworks. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a one line Rack application and move on to write a very simple web framework using this powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have asked about a gist of the code, here it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/4240848&#34;&gt;https://gist.github.com/4240848&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s the full script of the screen cast along with all of the code. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;update-1&#34;&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video is now available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/getting-started-with-rack&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;. A new screen cast subscription site that focuses on Ruby and related technologies, such as Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript and more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CoffeeScript: Fat Arrow Functions (Video)</title>
      <link>/2012/11/21/coffeescript-fat-arrow-functions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just started to work on a series of screencasts. The topics will be varied, but will center around Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, iOS, and the like, ranging in time from 2 minutes to 10-15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m just starting to get my feet wet in this area I thought I would share the first of these screencasts with everyone here in the hopes of getting some feedback, good or bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further adieu I offer up to you my first screencast, &amp;ldquo;CoffeeScript: Fat Arrow Functions&amp;rdquo;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://player.vimeo.com/video/54050364&#34; width=&#34;620&#34; height=&#34;350&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; webkitAllowFullScreen=&#34;webkitAllowFullScreen&#34; mozallowfullscreen=&#34;mozallowfullscreen&#34; allowFullScreen=&#34;allowFullScreen&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- sdfasdfasd --&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
