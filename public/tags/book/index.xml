      <title>Using Sprockets without Rails</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started working this week on an example application for the next book I&amp;rsquo;m about to write and I wanted a simple way for my readers to easily run the app (it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a single HTML file with a ton of cool JavaScript going on in it). My first choice for running this app was to use the popular Ruby library, &lt;a href=&#34;http://rack.rubyforge.org/&#34;&gt;Rack&lt;/a&gt;. If you are unfamiliar with Rack, please check it out. It provides a simple interface for writing web applications. By writing a simple Ruby file readers can use their favorite Rack compatible web server to launch the application. Sounds simple, eh? That&amp;rsquo;s because it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a simple Rack application written in a few lines of code I was able to start developing my example application. That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized I needed a good way to serve up all my &lt;a href=&#34;http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/&#34;&gt;CoffeeScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://sass-lang.com/&#34;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt; files. I was going to write a watchr script that did this, but I thought that was a bit heavy handed, and not very flexible, so I turned to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets&#34;&gt;Sprockets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprockets recently gained a lot of attention because it is bundled in with &lt;a href=&#34;http://guides.rubyonrails.org/3_1_release_notes.html&#34;&gt;Rails 3.1&lt;/a&gt; to serve up an application&amp;rsquo;s assets. It&amp;rsquo;s a clever little library that will process your files using CoffeeScript, Sass, etc&amp;hellip; and let you bundle them up in to a single asset by using a manifest. That was exactly what I wanted. After I spent the better part of an afternoon doing a bit of research and debugging here is the Rack configuration file I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/1184400.js&#34;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That will serve
&lt;pre&gt;/assets/application.css&lt;/pre&gt;
via Sprockets. The file itself will live in
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;pwd&amp;gt;/app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss&lt;/pre&gt;
The same goes for JavaScript files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this will save someone else a little of time when they&amp;rsquo;re trying to do the same thing. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming an &#39;Expert&#39; Developer</title>
      <link>/2010/11/17/becoming-an-expert-developer/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>/2010/11/17/becoming-an-expert-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I received an email from someone who used to work at a company that I used to work with. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know him, but he knew me through my work at the company, and my other exploits. He sent me an email to say that after a short time with the company he had been laid off, along with half of the development team. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t looking for pity, but rather advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of advice was he asking for, well, he quite simply needed to know how could he become an &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo; Ruby on Rails developer. First, let me say that this post won&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with Ruby, Rails, or any other specific programming language. Everything I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about is valid in ANY language on ANY platform. With that disclaimer, let&amp;rsquo;s move on, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: left; padding-right: 10px&#34; title=&#34;Monkey&#34; src=&#34;http://herd.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451e1dc69e2010536ad3deb970b-800wi&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;250&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While at this company he got introduced to Ruby on Rails and really loved it, coming from a non-Rails background. Since being laid off he&amp;rsquo;s been trying to land another Rails gig, but everyone is looking for &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo; Rails developers. So the question was, how to become an &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo; developer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep putting &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo; in quotes because, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest here, that&amp;rsquo;s a VERY subjective term. As someone who has hired many developers in his day, I can tell you that I&amp;rsquo;v&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;e hired newbies to &amp;lsquo;experts&amp;rsquo; and everywhere in between. Everyone has their merits and possibilities. I&amp;rsquo;ve met &amp;lsquo;experts&amp;rsquo; that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hire to take out my trash, let alone build my business. I&amp;rsquo;ve also met people right out of college that I would hire again and again. So your mileage my vary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; how do you build up that &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo; reputation? Let&amp;rsquo;s look at it. Below are some of things I&amp;rsquo;ve done, as well as some of the things that I look for as a hiring manager. Some are incredibly easy to do, others require work, but in the end they WILL pay off, and you&amp;rsquo;ll easily be at the head of the pack when going for that job.
&lt;h3&gt;Build Something&lt;/h3&gt;
When you are looking for a job people want to see what it is you&amp;rsquo;ve actually built. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t built anything, then how are you an expert? Build a lot of different things and put them up on the web for perspective employers to find and play around with. Use these are a playground for trying out all those cool new technologies you keep hearing about. Want to give NoSQL a try? Great, build an app that uses it. Need to improve your testing chops? Write an application and write all the tests you can possibly think of!
&lt;h3&gt;Get a GitHub Account&lt;/h3&gt;
I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how important GitHub has become when trying to make a name for yourself. It seems like unless you&amp;rsquo;re on GitHub, you&amp;rsquo;re nobody. While that might not be true, it certainly hurts more than it helps to not have an account. You know those apps you&amp;rsquo;ve just been building and playing around with? Post them on GitHub! Then put your profile page link on your resume. Yep, you read that right. Give those looking at your resume a link to your code. Let them see how good a developer you actually are. Show them you know how to code all the things you&amp;rsquo;ve got on your resume. Listing a language, platform, or tool on resume is one thing, but actually showing your perspective employer is another! They&amp;rsquo;ll love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;rsquo;re on GitHub, why not contribute to an open source project that&amp;rsquo;s up there. There are plenty of them, and they&amp;rsquo;re ALL looking for people to help out with their projects. Simply fork the projects, make some improvements, and then give those changes back to the projects owner. This looks great on a resume and really helps to show that you are interested and active in the community. Again, employers love this! Plus, you&amp;rsquo;ll be starting to build a name for yourself, and building a network, and a network is INCREDIBLY important when looking for work.
&lt;h3&gt;Blog and Write&lt;/h3&gt;
I should probably heed my own advice here and blog more often, but do as I say, not as I do. :) With that said I wrote a book, which looks AMAZING on a resume, but might be a bit out of reach for most people, so I recommend blogging instead. Why should you blog? Well, it shows that you have good communications skills, again very important to most employers. It can also show that you have a deep understanding of whatever it is you blog about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should you write about? If you&amp;rsquo;re stuck on a topic, might I make a recommendation or two. First, when you&amp;rsquo;re building those applications I mentioned early if you run into a bug or something else that got you a bit stuck, blog about it! Others could really benefit from your experience. Explain the problem and how you went about solving it. Another great thing to write about is your favorite libraries or plugins. Pick a different one each week and dissect it. Write about how it works, what it does, etc&amp;hellip; This is a great exercise in both writing and learning about how things work. Very valuable.
&lt;h3&gt;Network&lt;/h3&gt;
I mentioned earlier that a good network is INCREDIBLY important when looking for work, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying. It&amp;rsquo;s the most important thing. A good network will constantly be feeding you new opportunities, or putting you in touch with those who can. So how do you develop that network? A few ways, I mentioned contributing to open source earlier, that&amp;rsquo;s a great way. Another great way is through conferences, hackfests, rumbles, and whatever other local (and non-local) events are being held in your development community of choice. Attend these events, participate, introduce yourself, speak, buy drinks, whatever! Just get out there and NETWORK!!
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
The gentleman who emailed me said that he was reading a lot of books in hopes of becoming an &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo;. While I&amp;rsquo;m not going to tell you not to read books (you should!!), I will tell you that there is no substitute for doing. All of things I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about above are ALL about doing. Reading is not doing, it&amp;rsquo;s reading. It&amp;rsquo;s passive and will not get you further in your career. There&amp;rsquo;s no place on a resume for the books you&amp;rsquo;ve read. Take what you&amp;rsquo;ve read and put it into action, then you&amp;rsquo;ll be on your way to becoming an &amp;lsquo;expert&amp;rsquo; developer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Book Review is a 5-Star One!</title>
      <link>/2009/11/19/first-book-review-is-a-5-star-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>/2009/11/19/first-book-review-is-a-5-star-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About.com became the first, that I know about, to review my book, &amp;laquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;raquo;. What a great first review to have as well. They rated the book 5 out of 5 stars! The review can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby.about.com/od/bookreviews/gr/distributedprogramming.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;laquo;Anyone working with distributed programming in Ruby will want this book.&amp;raquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The only downside they saw in the book, was that they wanted it to be longer! I have to save something for the 2nd edition, don&amp;rsquo;t I? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased yours yet, I encourage you to do so. It&amp;rsquo;s on sale at &lt;a href=&#34;http://book.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have reviewed the book, or know of a review of the book, please pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: left; padding-right: 10px&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-231&#34; title=&#34;Distributed Programming with Ruby&#34; src=&#34;/assets/images/2009/06/0321638360_bates_mech_page_3-261x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Distributed Programming with Ruby&#34; width=&#34;261&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well folks, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long road, nearly a year since I presented the idea for &amp;laquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;raquo; to Obie Fernandez in a hot tub in Florida, but finally my book is done, dusted, back from the printers and available for purchase from a variety of places, include &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an absolutely amazing experience and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank everyone involved with the project enough for all of their help, guidance, and having to put up with me over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go into detail about all the people I wish to thank, but I did that already in the book, and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, you&amp;rsquo;re going to buy it and read it anyway, so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to ruin the surprise. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased your copy, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t might I recommend you pop over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now and pick yourself up a copy. They&amp;rsquo;re selling pretty well and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out, do you? I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are someone with a popular blog and you would like to do a review of the book, please drop me a line and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what we can do about hooking you up with a copy. Please understand, though, the publishers aren&amp;rsquo;t going to send out copies to everyone who requests them, so there will be a bit of vetting going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have already purchased the book if you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind leaving a review of it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, that would be much appreciated. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where you bought the book, if you could leave a review there, it will really make a difference. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;buy-distributed-programming-with-ruby-today-http-books-markbates-com&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Buy &amp;laquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;raquo; Today!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

      <title>A Few Rails Nuggets</title>
      <link>/2009/09/07/a-few-rails-nuggets/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>mark&#43;blog@markbates.com (Mark Bates)</author>
      <guid>/2009/09/07/a-few-rails-nuggets/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So with my book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://my.safaribooksonline.com:80/9780321669919&#34;&gt;Distributed Programming with Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, finally finished, and a nice long weekend I was able to sit down and work on a little pet project of mine. I decided to work on a little site that I could use to track my rather large Pez collection. (Yes, I know, I collect Pez - so what!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While working on it I got to use some new technologies that I really haven&amp;rsquo;t had a chance to play, so I thought I would talk a bit about some of the ones I liked the most.
&lt;h3&gt;Authlogic&lt;/h3&gt;
Love it! Finally a decent authentication system! The thing I love most about it? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate a lot of crap in your project. If I were to say one bad thing about it, it would be that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t generate enough in your project. :) I know that sounds silly, but it&amp;rsquo;s the truth. It gives you so much power, without having to generate a ton of lib code and crazy controller code, which is awesome. However, it would be nice if it had a generator that generated a &amp;lsquo;basic&amp;rsquo; application for you. Just a little thing, apart from that, love it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master&#34;&gt;http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cucumber/Webrat&lt;/h3&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m sure by now everyone has heard of Cucumber. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend that I&amp;rsquo;m the first to that party! Over the last month or so I&amp;rsquo;ve really started to use it and it has completely changed my life. That&amp;rsquo;s not an overstatement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cucumber lets you write features and scenario in human readable format. Combine that with Webrat, which lets you do things like click buttons and follow links, you can write some amazing tests that look like something a project manager would write! Brilliant!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tests beat the hell out of Rails integration tests. Trust me! I love watching Cucumber and Webrat click around my site while I just watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cukes.info/&#34;&gt;http://cukes.info/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master&#34;&gt;http://github.com/brynary/webrat/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web App Theme Generator&lt;/h3&gt;
This cool little plugin helps you to quickly generate a very useful, and laid out, theme for your application. The themes would be familiar to anyone who has used sites like Lighthouse. They&amp;rsquo;re basic, but they are very well coded and get you on your quickly so you can have something that looks fairly decent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only gripe with this plugin is that it is a bit clumsy to use, but thankfully you don&amp;rsquo;t have to run it very often, only when you create a new controller/resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gravityblast.com/2009/07/30/2-minutes-admin-layout-with-rails-and-the-web-app-theme-generator/&#34;&gt;http://gravityblast.com/2009/07/30/2-minutes-admin-layout-with-rails-and-the-web-app-theme-generator/&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Delayed Job&lt;/h3&gt;
The last piece of tech is Delayed Job. I first discovered Delayed Job when I wrote about it in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://my.safaribooksonline.com:80/9780321669919&#34;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. It is a great way to handle and process background tasks. It&amp;rsquo;s easy, reliable, and scales really well. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using the Collective Idea fork of the project. It has a generator to create the migration you need. It also has a nice binary to run in the background on your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also been using a little gem I wrote that gives me hooks into Hoptoad, the is_paranoid gem, and a nice subclass for writing workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been completely enamored with Delayed Job from the first moment I used it, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you haven&amp;rsquo;t checked it out yet, and you do, you&amp;rsquo;ll feel the same!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/tree/master&#34;&gt;http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/markbates/delayed_job_extras/tree/master&#34;&gt;http://github.com/markbates/delayed_job_extras/tree/master&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go, that&amp;rsquo;s just a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with lately, that I think are going to become mainstays in any Rails project I work on. Hopefully this has given you a little for for thought on things you can use in your next project.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Almost There... Book Wise.</title>
      <link>/2009/07/27/almost-there-book-wise/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jul 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>mark&#43;blog@markbates.com (Mark Bates)</author>
      <guid>/2009/07/27/almost-there-book-wise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m now entering the home stretch of writing the Distributed Programming with Ruby book. I&amp;rsquo;m just a few weeks away, well, technically I&amp;rsquo;m hours away from finishing the last chapter (Delayed Job) in the official table of contents, however, I&amp;rsquo;m going to add another chapter and a half. Why? Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m a glutton for punishment. That and I want to deliver the best book possible. The extra chapter and a half, not featured in the table of contents below, will be on MapReduce technologies. It&amp;rsquo;s a really hot topic, and I think it will fit well in the book. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del datetime=&#34;2009-07-29T03:01:37+00:00&#34;&gt;Unfortunately, the &amp;laquo;Rough Cuts&amp;raquo; book on O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s Safari site hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in nearly 3 months! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. I keep asking my editor to update it, but it hasn&amp;rsquo;t happened yet. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will soon, especially since the first draft of the entire manuscript will be done in just a few weeks!&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Today they updated the &amp;laquo;Rough Cuts&amp;raquo; with nearly the latest revisions. It&amp;rsquo;s still missing the chapters on Delayed Job and BackgrounDRb, but it&amp;rsquo;s closer than it was yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as a public service announcement to you, the readers, I thought I would the table of contents as it stands right now, so you have a better idea of what the book is going to be about. So here it goes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/156861.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Does it look good? Is this something you&amp;rsquo;d buy? Let me know. This is your chance to have an influence on a book. If you think something is missing or should be laid out differently, please let me know, it might just make it into the final product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, enough delaying here, let me get back to writing so I can finish up the Delayed Job chapter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Evolving Table of Contents</title>
      <link>/2009/06/20/the-evolving-table-of-contents/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>mark&#43;blog@markbates.com (Mark Bates)</author>
      <guid>/2009/06/20/the-evolving-table-of-contents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have checked out the Rough Cuts version of my book, &amp;laquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;raquo;, I thought you would like to get a peek into how the Table of Contents is going to change shortly. For those of you who haven&amp;rsquo;t seen the old Table of Contents, or are just plain old interested to see what&amp;rsquo;s going to be in the book, or to see how far along with the book I am, here is the current Table of Contents as of tonight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;http://gist.github.com/133394.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see it has evolved quite a bit from what was posted on Rough Cuts just about a month ago. Chances are that it will probably change again, and as it does, I&amp;rsquo;ll try and keep you all posted. There is talk of adding a large chapter at the end that takes a handful of the technologies I discuss in the book and use them to build a &amp;laquo;real world&amp;raquo; example application, like a Twitter clone, or something like that. If anyone has any good ideas on what they would like to see for this example, please them my way, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are no sections listed below a particular chapter that means that I have either not written it yet, or I&amp;rsquo;m still too early in that chapter&amp;rsquo;s development to have properly assigned it actual sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first draft of the book is slated for the end of July. So there is still a lot of work to be done, but it&amp;rsquo;s still rather exciting. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s exciting for me at least. Talk to you all soon.&lt;/p&gt;
