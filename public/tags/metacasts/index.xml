      <title>MetaCasts.tv Acquired by O&#39;Reilly Media</title>

&lt;p&gt;For the past two and half years I have prided myself on bringing MetaCasts.tv subscribers high quality, educational screencasts on a variety of subjects, from Ruby to JavaScript to Go. In that time I have produced almost 37 hours of video. It has been a remarkably fun ride, but that ride has now come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I announced that MetaCasts.tv would be shutting down there was a lot of speculation as to why, but at the time I was unable to provide any specifics behind it. Well, now I can. I’m happy to announce that O’Reilly Media, Inc. has acquired MetaCasts.tv. Over the coming months I will work closely with the great team over at O’Reilly to make all of the MetaCasts content available on their properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I will not be joining the O’Reilly team, I will, however, be producing new content with them from time to time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about the opportunity to see these screencasts get in the hands of a lot of developers, to help them grow and learn, and I can’t think of a better partner to do that with than O’Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all, again, for your great support over the past two and a half years. It’s been wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to Sean Powell, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/seanpowell&#34;&gt;@seanpowell&lt;/a&gt;, who won last month&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;/2014/09/01/100th-episode--a-free-ticket-to-gothamgo/&#34;&gt;contest&lt;/a&gt; to win a free ticket to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gothamgo.com&#34;&gt;GothamGo&lt;/a&gt; conference in New York City in November, courtesy of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv?source=blog&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really excited that MetaCasts is sponsoring this great conference, and I&amp;rsquo;m even more excited that I was able to help someone like Sean, a supporter of MetaCasts, get to go to the conference. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already purchased your ticket for the conference, you should hurry up, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to be there, find me, come say hi, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget to ask me for a MetaCasts sticker!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;win-a-free-ticket-to-gothamgo&#34;&gt;Win a Free Ticket to GothamGO!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I released the 100th episode of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts&lt;/a&gt;! To help celebrate that I want to give one lucky subscriber a free ticket to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://gothamgo.com&#34;&gt;GothamGo&lt;/a&gt; conference in New York City on November 15th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On October 1st I will choose a winner from the active MetaCasts subscribers with a yearly plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current subscribers&lt;/strong&gt;: If you&amp;rsquo;re already a yearly subscriber, congrats, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything to enter. If you&amp;rsquo;re a monthly subscriber, just upgrade to a yearly plan and you&amp;rsquo;ll be entered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone else&lt;/strong&gt;: For those of you who aren&amp;rsquo;t subscribers, what are you waiting for? Register as a yearly subscriber between now and the end of September to be entered to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro-tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Yearly team subscriptions get more entries in the contest. For example, if you have a yearly team plan for 5 members then you have 5 chances to win. Pretty simple. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck to everyone, and if I haven&amp;rsquo;t said it lately, thank you again for all of your support!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;rsquo;s (100th) episode: &lt;a href=&#34;http://metacasts.tv/casts/bundling-assets&#34;&gt;Bundling Assets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MetaCasts Golang Future</title>
      <link>/2014/07/08/metacasts-golang-future/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>mark&#43;blog@markbates.com (Mark Bates)</author>
      <guid>/2014/07/08/metacasts-golang-future/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/assets/images/2014/07/gopher.png&#34; class=&#39;img-left&#39;&gt;In January of 2013 I launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; with the idea that I would generate a new screencast each week on whatever technology excited me that week. I wanted MetaCasts to be a place where developers could come and learn about topics related to their current needs, as well as technologies they might not have thought to try, or have even heard about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the past year and a half two things happened that have made me question this philosophy, and the overall direction of MetaCasts. The first is feedback from subscribers. The biggest complaint/criticism I&amp;rsquo;ve received is that the topics are too varied. One week it&amp;rsquo;s Ruby, the next week it&amp;rsquo;s JavaScript, the week after that Go, etc&amp;hellip; People are unsure about what they&amp;rsquo;re subscribing to. I can understand this. If you don&amp;rsquo;t care about, say, Backbone, why should you have to sit through five weeks of it to get to the topics you enjoy? I got it. Message received.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second change that has happened in the last year has been my discovering and falling in love with &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt;. I think Go is just the bee&amp;rsquo;s knees. Because of this I&amp;rsquo;m finding it very hard to generate screencasts on topics such as Ruby or Ruby on Rails when all I want to do is talk about Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these two thoughts in my mind, one being the need to focus MetaCasts, and the other being my desire to spend more time with Go I have decided to stop generating Ruby screencasts on MetaCasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not an easy decision to make. I know I&amp;rsquo;m going to lose some/a lot of subscribers because of this. I&amp;rsquo;m OK with that. Ruby is great, it&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful language, and I continue to use it every day, but I have to follow my heart, and by following my heart I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make better and more interesting screencasts, and after all, that is what this is all about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will still be covering JavaScript topics, although they will be more focused as well. For example, I will no longer be making any more videos about frameworks such as Ember.js or Backbone.js, but I will continue to generate videos on Angular.js, as I think it is a great companion for Go (and any other back-end technology).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that people understand why I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to make these changes. I will continue to keep all previously recorded videos, regardless of topic, available to subscribers, nothing is changing there. The only change is going forward all videos will be about Go or JavaScript (as it relates to Go).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all my current, past, and present subscribers, and I hope everyone will come along for the ride! It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a blast!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MetaCasts.tv Episode Stats</title>
      <link>/2014/03/28/metacaststv-episode-stats/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Mar 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When I first started &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; in January of 2013 I set out to create a unique screen cast series. I wanted a series that didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on just one topic, just Ruby, just JavaScript, etc&amp;hellip; instead I wanted something that would challenge my subscribers, as well as myself. I wanted to talk about all sorts of technologies. I knew that some weeks the topic at hand might be incredibly relevant to viewers, and that other weeks it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. My hope was, and still is, that the weeks were the topic isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;relevant&amp;rdquo; that viewers will learn something new that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to grow and learn about topics outside of my daily comfort zone, so I&amp;rsquo;ve made &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; a venue for that. There are some episodes where I know the topic intimately, and there are others where I sat down, studied the topic, wrote lots of code, and presented my findings. All of it an educational experience as much for me, as my viewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out of curiosity I thought I would take a quick look some numbers related to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; and the topics that I&amp;rsquo;ve been covering there for just over the past year, and I thought I would share them with you. Personally, I found these numbers to be incredibly interesting. I was, for example very surprised to find out what language (programming, not spoken) was most prominently featured in the episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;total-hours-of-video-22-19-42&#34;&gt;Total Hours of Video: 22:19:42&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this post I have produced over 22 hours of video! I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe it. I&amp;rsquo;m super happy with that number. That means as a subscriber you could fly from Boston to Sydney and still have episodes left over to watch!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;average-video-length-00-17-23&#34;&gt;Average Video Length: 00:17:23&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The average length of a MetaCasts episode is just over 17 minutes. That means over your morning cup of coffee or breakfast you can watch a whole episode and impress your friends at work with your depth of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-s-all-about-javascript-coffeescript&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s All About JavaScript (CoffeeScript)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at how much time I&amp;rsquo;ve spent covering different languages it would appear the clear winner is JavaScript/CoffeeScript, with Ruby in second place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align=&#39;center&#39;&gt;
  &lt;thead class=&#39;language-table&#39;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Language&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Total # of Hours&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody class=&#39;language-table&#39;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; CoffeeScript &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 13:05:26 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Ruby &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 06:37:19 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Go &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 01:00:56 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Bash &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:43:07 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; JavaScript &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:26:20 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; SQL &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:14:30 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt; Other &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; 00:12:04 &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These numbers are determined by the &amp;ldquo;primary language&amp;rdquo; of the video. For example a video about Ember.js would be listed as CoffeeScript, or JavaScript, even though the back-end might have been written using Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-purchased-video&#34;&gt;Most Purchased Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most purchased video on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; is not surprising considering most subscribers are also Ruby on Rails developers; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/ember-js-pts-1-5-updated&#34;&gt;Ember.js Pts 1 - 5 [UPDATED]&lt;/a&gt;. Ember is an incredibly hot topic these days, especially amongst Rails developers, and whole of people have turned to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; to help them learn about it, and I&amp;rsquo;m honored to have helped them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just for completeness the second most purchased video on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/angular-js-revised-pts-1-4&#34;&gt;Angular.js (revised) Pts 1 - 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People can&amp;rsquo;t get enough of JavaScript frameworks, and neither can I. I love playing with them, and I love presenting my findings, sometimes good, sometimes bad, to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-watched-video&#34;&gt;Most Watched Video&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most watched video on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; was from February of 2013, in which I covered the recently released &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv/casts/ruby-2-0-0-rc2&#34;&gt;Ruby 2.0.0-rc2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, those are just a few of the fun numbers from over the past year or so. Looking at those numbers the ideal subscriber is a Ruby developer who wants to level up their JavaScript/CoffeeScript skills, as well as their Ruby, and along the way perhaps learn a bit about Go, SQL, Bash, and other fun stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with how things are going with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve received amazing support from the community, subscribers, friends, and so many great people. So I guess as long as you&amp;rsquo;re willing to come along for the ride with me, I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to keep generating new episodes for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Team Subscriptions for MetaCasts.tv</title>
      <link>/2013/12/10/team-subscriptions-for-metacaststv/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Dec 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;On January 1st of this year I &lt;a href=&#34;/2013/01/01/announcing-metacaststv-screen-casts/&#34;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a weekly screencast site called, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv?source=blog-team-metacasts&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;, and I have been thrilled with the response it has received over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it&amp;rsquo;s first year I&amp;rsquo;ve released over 60 videos (17+ hours) on Ruby, Rails, Go, JavaScript, Node, Redis, iOS, and so much more, and next year I plan on releasing even more great videos on those topics, as well as new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The response I&amp;rsquo;ve received for MetaCasts has been overwhelming positive. I get stopped at conferences by subscribers (from around the world) who just want to tell me how much they enjoy my videos. I get emails, tweets, and more thanking me for helping shed some light on an issue someone was having or for introducing them to a new topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that team support has been added to MetaCasts making it easier for companies and organizations to easily help their members level up their development skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team subscriptions are simple and easy to use. Simply create a new team subscription and enter the GitHub usernames of the users you want to have access to MetaCasts. That&amp;rsquo;s it. When they login, using their GitHub username, they&amp;rsquo;ll have full access to all of the MetaCasts episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pricing for team subscriptions depends on the amount of team members on the subscription. Team subscriptions, like single user subscriptions, come in both monthly and yearly plans, with yearly plans offering a significant discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with team subscriptions, as people have been asking for them for a while now. Learning, and growing, as a developer is incredibly important, so I encourage team leaders, managers, etc&amp;hellip; to help their teams out and sign up today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sign-up-metacasts-tv-http-www-metacasts-tv-source-blog-team-metacasts&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv?source=blog-team-metacasts&#34;&gt;Sign up - MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

      <guid>/2013/01/01/announcing-metacaststv-screen-casts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite things to do is learn. I love learning. It&amp;rsquo;s been a central tenet of my life. When I was 11 I taught myself to play guitar and then ended up receiving an honors BA degree in music years later. During college I taught myself how to program and have spent the last 14 years as a professional developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve parlayed my love of learning into a successful career that has included working with some of the brightest minds in the industry, authoring two books, and speaking at conferences all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite ways to learn is through video. I love watching videos about technology. I love seeing it in action. I love hearing the tips and tricks as they come up. I find it to be an incredibly immersive and engaging experience, as well as a fun way to learn. It&amp;rsquo;s like having a pairing partner right there with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my love of screen casts and learning I have decided to launch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt;! MetaCasts are weekly screen casts that center around Ruby and related technologies, such as JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Rails, etc&amp;hellip; All of the screen casts are presented in HD and are available to watch on all platforms! You can even subscribe to them in iTunes and new episodes will automatically be downloaded for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of right now there will be a guaranteed new video each week. Some weeks there will be more, but never less. When I reach a threshold of subscribers to focus on MetaCasts 100% then you can expect 2-3 videos a week, plus longer form videos as well. If you&amp;rsquo;d like that to happen, then I strongly encourage you to sign up now, and spread the word!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about this new venture, and I hope you are too! So please head on over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.metacasts.tv&#34;&gt;MetaCasts.tv&lt;/a&gt; now and check it out. You won&amp;rsquo;t be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#39;text-align: center&#39;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.metacasts.tv&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39; class=&#39;btn btn-large btn-primary&#39;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check out MetaCasts.tv&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
