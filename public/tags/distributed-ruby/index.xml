      <description>&lt;p&gt;About.com became the first, that I know about, to review my book, &amp;laquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;raquo;. What a great first review to have as well. They rated the book 5 out of 5 stars! The review can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://ruby.about.com/od/bookreviews/gr/distributedprogramming.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;laquo;Anyone working with distributed programming in Ruby will want this book.&amp;raquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The only downside they saw in the book, was that they wanted it to be longer! I have to save something for the 2nd edition, don&amp;rsquo;t I? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased yours yet, I encourage you to do so. It&amp;rsquo;s on sale at &lt;a href=&#34;http://book.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have reviewed the book, or know of a review of the book, please pass it along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&#34;float: left; padding-right: 10px&#34; class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-231&#34; title=&#34;Distributed Programming with Ruby&#34; src=&#34;/assets/images/2009/06/0321638360_bates_mech_page_3-261x300.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Distributed Programming with Ruby&#34; width=&#34;261&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well folks, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long road, nearly a year since I presented the idea for &amp;laquo;Distributed Programming with Ruby&amp;raquo; to Obie Fernandez in a hot tub in Florida, but finally my book is done, dusted, back from the printers and available for purchase from a variety of places, include &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an absolutely amazing experience and I can&amp;rsquo;t thank everyone involved with the project enough for all of their help, guidance, and having to put up with me over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would go into detail about all the people I wish to thank, but I did that already in the book, and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, you&amp;rsquo;re going to buy it and read it anyway, so I don&amp;rsquo;t want to ruin the surprise. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve already purchased your copy, but if you haven&amp;rsquo;t might I recommend you pop over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now and pick yourself up a copy. They&amp;rsquo;re selling pretty well and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out, do you? I didn&amp;rsquo;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are someone with a popular blog and you would like to do a review of the book, please drop me a line and I&amp;rsquo;ll see what we can do about hooking you up with a copy. Please understand, though, the publishers aren&amp;rsquo;t going to send out copies to everyone who requests them, so there will be a bit of vetting going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, if you have already purchased the book if you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t mind leaving a review of it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://books.markbates.com&#34;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, that would be much appreciated. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where you bought the book, if you could leave a review there, it will really make a difference. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
